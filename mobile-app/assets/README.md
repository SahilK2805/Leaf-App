# Assets Folder

This folder should contain app icons and images.

## Required for Production Builds:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen (1242x2436px recommended)
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024px)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (48x48px)

## For Development (Expo Go):

These assets are **optional** for development. Expo Go will use default icons if these files are missing.

## Creating Assets:

You can create these later when building for production, or use online tools like:
- https://www.appicon.co/
- https://makeappicon.com/

For now, the app will work fine in Expo Go without these files.
